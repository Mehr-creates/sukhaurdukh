# SukhaurDukh

Welcome to the SukhaurDukh project repository! This project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive online mental health helpline, accessible to everyone at no cost. Our platform is designed to offer professional counseling, community support, and a wealth of resources to help individuals manage emotional and psychological challenges.

## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

This repository includes a CI workflow, defined in the `ci-workflow.yml` file, that automates the process of integrating changes to the codebase. The workflow is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the main branch, ensuring that all contributions are built and tested according to predefined criteria before integration.

### Key Features of CI Workflow:
- **Automated Testing and Building:** Ensures that every push or pull request to the main branch is automatically tested and built.
- **Merge Request Validation:** Confirms that all merge requests meet the necessary criteria for testing and building before they are integrated into the main branch.
- **Manual Triggers:** Allows the workflow to be triggered manually through the GitHub Actions tab for additional flexibility.

The CI workflow uses the latest Ubuntu runner and performs initial setup tasks, including echoing a welcome message and setting the stage for further build, test, and deployment processes.
